### My Learnings 
> This is a project installation related tips.
    1. I wrote npm create Vite@latest to start a vite project
    2. this will ask for a project name , enter project as Contactus
    3. with same project name we will have a new folder now
    4. CD to get into Contactus
    5.  to start installation of dependencies
        ```bash
        npm i
    6. npm run dev to run project  _This command is used to run a script named dev that is defined in your project's package.json file under the "scripts" section_
    7. text formatting in .md file searched in to understand many other options

> This is a CSS related tips.
    1. in CSS don't set height and width for the parent , otherwise you will see scroll bars , better set it to 100vh
    2. start from figma layers , as many as layers you see , you can create initally . or you can define the layer one by one with respective CSS
    3. later option I have tried , minor issues related to Img vs div vs nav decision 
    4. minor issue related to setting margin, height , width
    5. so lets design one layer at a time.

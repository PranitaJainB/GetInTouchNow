### My Learnings

#### Project Installation Tips

1. Run `npm create vite@latest` to start a Vite project.
2. When prompted for a project name, enter `Contactus`.
3. This will create a new folder with the same project name.
4. Change directory to `Contactus`:

    ```bash
    cd Contactus
    ```

5. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

6. Run the project:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

   _This command runs a script named `dev` defined in your project's `package.json` file under the "scripts" section._

7. For text formatting in `.md` files, search for more options to understand various formatting features.

#### CSS Related Tips

1. In CSS, avoid setting explicit height and width for the parent element, as it may cause scroll bars. Instead, set it to `100vh`.
2. Start by designing layers in Figma. Create as many layers as you see initially or define them one by one with the respective CSS.
3. The latter option may involve minor issues related to deciding between `img`, `div`, or `nav` elements.
4. Pay attention to issues related to setting margin, height, and width.
5. Design one layer at a time for a cleaner approach.
6. tell chatgpt to produce correct md file , don't use the manual copy instead use copy button at the bottom
7. run following command to run the project's index.html file
   ```bash
   npm run dev

 _This command runs a script named `dev` defined in your project's `package.json` file under the "scripts" section._

7. For text formatting in `.md` files, search for more options to understand various formatting features.

8. we will be using css modules this time so that at top level there is no conflict about style class names.
9. delet content of index.css , app.css which was default  . Global CSS vs Module CSS. How it works ?
10. use shortcut to print react function using snippet : ***rafce***  = react arrow function compoenent with export
